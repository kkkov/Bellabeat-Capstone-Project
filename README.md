# Bellabeat Capstone Project in R

## Introduction to the Project

The following represents an overview of the key parts of a case study with which I was tasked at the final stage of the Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate. This project analyses data of more than 30 FitBit users in the span of a month in order to gain insights that would inform the growth and marketing strategies of Bellabeat.

### About the company

Bellabeat is a high-tech manufacturer of health-focused products for women, such as a wellness tracker, a wellness watch, a water bottle that tracks daily water intake, and an app that provides users with health data.

As the company is looking for more opportunities for growth, they have tasked me with analyzing smart device usage data in order to identify consumer trends and propose high-level recommendations to inform the Bellabeat's marketing strategy.

### Business task

Identify new growth opportunities in order to scale the business and become a larger player in the global smart device market.

I will do this by identifying consumer trends in wellness smart device usage and propose recommendations with the aim to exploit those trends.

## Summary of the analysis

The analysis that will be visualized below confirmed some logical hypotheses, such as the existence of a positive correlation between, among others:

* the number of intensities subjects had during the day and their heartrate
* the amount of steps people made and the calories they exhausted

Interestingly, I observed that there is a significant negative correlation between the amount of minutes subjects spent in a sedentary mode, presumably seated, laying, or overall relaxed and immobile, and the time they slept throughout the night.

Overall, tracking device users were most active between 5 and 8 pm, noting that there is also a measurable increase in activity around 12 pm.

Subjects made the most amount of steps on Saturday, with Monday and Tuesday coming in short second and third, respecitvely. Likewise, users are performing the most amount of intense activities on Saturday, Tuesday, and Monday.

Conversely, users are least active on Sunday both in terms of steps taken, as well as the amount of intensities recorded.

This can be linked to the observation that users tend to sleep the most on Sunday, and, with the exception of Wednesday, sleep less during the week.

Calories-wise, similar patterns are present. The days in which users exhaust the most amount of calories are Saturday, Tuesday, and Monday, while Sunday and Thursday are on the opposite end.

These trends represent the key insights that would allow us to answer the questions the business is asking and inform the future growth strategy of the company.
